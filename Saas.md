SaaS is a business and software delivery model that gives organizations the ability to offer their solutions in a low-friction, service-centric model that maximizes value for customers and providers. It relies on agility and operational efficiency as pillars of a business strategy that promotes growth, reach, and innovation.
- SaaS places more emphasis on the experience customers will have with your service
- how rapidly you can introduce features that address customer needs. Details associated with how your service is built, operated, and managed are out of your customer’s view.
> we think about this SaaS service as we would with any other service we might consume. If we’re in a restaurant, we certainly care about the food, but we also care about the service. How quickly does your server come to your table, how often do they refill your water, how fast does the food come—these are all measures of the service experience. This is the same mindset and value system that should shape how we think about building a SaaS service.
